     This week in class we started learning about the different robot games. We started with first robotics and ended with the JPL inventions challange. We designed differnt types of robots to comply with the different robot games. Over all I had fun this week.

     This week was very fun. We learned about M-E and did fun activities alongside with it. On wednesday we did the wednesday challenge, which consisted of designing and building a rubber band boat. My boat went the farest distence, but had no ruber band to power it. I just blew on it. Overall this week was fun.
