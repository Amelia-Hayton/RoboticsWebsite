     This week in class we started learning about the different robot games. We started with first robotics and ended with the JPL inventions challange. We designed differnt types of robots to comply with the different robot games. Over all I had fun this week.

     This week was very fun. We learned about M-E and did fun activities alongside with it. On wednesday we did the wednesday challenge, which consisted of designing and building a rubber band boat. My boat went the farest distence, but had no rubber band to power it. I just blew on it. Overall this week was fun.

     For my machine, I started of by drawing the design out on paper. Then after that I went onto tinkercad and cadded up the design. I made sure to do all the necsesary steps in order to get a good finished project. After that we started gathering up materials, and when we had all of our materials I started to construct my design. Eventually after a lot of boxes I finsihed building it. For our Thursday challanges we had to measure out wood to be exact. I used a method which included measuring at multiple points to get the best cut. When done with that, we went downstairs and used the table saw to cut the wood. Overally this was all very fun.

     For this project we had to come up with and build a Rube Goldberg Contraction. We had to design and build it with simple supplies and it was for our mechanical engineering week. After drawing the concept we had to CAD it up on tinkercad, a free browser based cadding website, and get the dementions excatly how we wanted them. When we were done with that we built our contraptions.
